    "daily_calorie_target": "number",
    "macro_targets": {
      "protein_g": "number",
      "carbs_g": "number",
      "fat_g": "number"
    }
  },
  "workouts": {
    "logged_workouts": ["array_of_workout_objects"],
    "planned_workouts": ["array_of_planned_workouts"]
  },
  "nutrition": {
    "daily_logs": ["array_of_daily_nutrition_logs"],
    "favorite_foods": ["array_of_food_items"],
    "meal_plans": ["array_of_meal_plans"]
  },
  "recipes": {
    "saved_recipes": ["array_of_recipe_objects"]
  },
  "calendar": {

  }
}
```

### **Core Technologies**
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **AI/ML**: LangChain + OpenAI GPT-4
- **Database**: TinyDB (JSON-based NoSQL)
- **Async Processing**: Python asyncio
- **Dependencies**: See requirements.txt

### **Agent Workflow**
